Keaton C Green is a Shriver Peaceworker Fellow and graduate student in Geography and Environmental Systems at UMBC, where his work blends community practice, advanced spatial analysis, and critical urban research. His fellowship placement at Healthy Neighborhoods Inc. centers on homeowner repair programs, senior support, reinvestment strategy, and the everyday infrastructures of neighborhood stability, a focus that resonates with urban political economy approaches to community development.

He is a technically skilled GIS analyst who designs and executes complex multi stage spatial workflows across ArcGIS Pro and R, often involving geodatabase management, spatial joins, NEAR analysis, summary statistics, and multi level data integration. His academic projects span Baltimore neighborhood dynamics, NYC rat complaint patterns, COVID 19 ZCTA to tract allocations, Overpass Turbo extractions, and large-scale geoprocessing replications, work that aligns with contemporary discussions of spatial data and geographic problem solving.

Keaton’s research agenda engages deeply with cultural capital, vacancy, reinvestment, boundary making, and the governance of place. He integrates authors such as Stewart, Baird, Colburn, Haraway, and Carter into spatial analyses that interrogate how inequality becomes materially and symbolically encoded in the urban landscape, reflecting the critical traditions of qualitative and interpretive geography.

Alongside research, he maintains a professional digital presence, building and troubleshooting an academic website through GitHub Pages and crafting clear analytical and administrative documents. His work also includes program management tools in Excel, data organization systems, and communication with contractors, attorneys, community members, and institutional partners.

Overall, Keaton brings together a community-centered ethic, strong technical expertise, and a theoretically grounded critique of urban processes. His profile reflects the combination of applied practice, methodological rigor, and critical reflection that characterizes the most compelling work in contemporary human geography.
